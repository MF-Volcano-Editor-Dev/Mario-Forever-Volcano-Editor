About animations in AnimationShape in Mario's scene:
	There is only two libraries for the animation player AnimationShape:
	> small: Animations to control shapes in small-sized suits
	> big: Animations to control ones in grown-sized suits
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	In each library, only two animations exists there:
	> RESET: To control shapes when Mario is NOT crouching
	> crouch: To control shapes when Mario IS crouching down
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	An AnimationPlayer is used to control properties of a node or nodes in the dock of the editor, providing direct visual access to them in the track(s) of a property, which makes freshmen easier to edit these properties in different states of an object

About adding and removing an extra suit for Mario:
	1. Make a suit component. MarioSmall in Mario can be a good template for you, or you can extend an inheritance from it
	2. After the completion of the suit you made, drag it under the node Mario
	3. Set the `process_mode` to "Disabled" and disable its visibility
	4. If you want to remove the extra suits, just select and delete them
