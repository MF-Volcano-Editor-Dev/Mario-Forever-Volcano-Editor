1. DO MAKE SURE the `layer` is the same as one where the player is, default layer of 2D is 0.
2. The shape of \"DeathLine\" is [WorldBorder2D], so there's no worry about detection error.

To edit the height of death line:
1. Tick on <Make children editable>.
2. Drag the \"DeathLine\" child node to a position where you expect it to be."
